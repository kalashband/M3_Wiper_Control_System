# Implementation

* STM32 Cube IDE is use with windows build tools, openOCD, QEMU packages.STM32Vube is software ecosystem. STM32CubeIDE is an advanced C/C++ development platform with peripheral configuration, code generation, code compilation, and debug features for STM32 microcontrollers and microprocessors. It is based on the Eclipse®/CDT™ framework and GCC toolchain for the development, and GDB for the debugging. It allows the integration of the hundreds of existing plugins that complete the features of the Eclipse IDE.
* The C preprocessor is a macro processor that is used automatically by the C compiler to transform your program before actual compilation. It is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.
* Used Concept 
 - Function Pointer : A Function pointer is a pointer that store the address of the function and invokes the function whenever required.
 - Structure : structure is a key word that create user defined data type in c. Struct key word is used to create structure.
 - Pointers : The pointer in c is variable that store address of another variable.
